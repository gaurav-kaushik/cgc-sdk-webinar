#Seven Bridges Cancer Genomics Cloud -- Deploying your own tools

## Overview
####This project contains these tools and workflows:
- sonnet-grep (tool)
- dna2protein (workflow)
	- transcribe (tool)
	- translate (tool)
- GeneExpressionWF (workflow) 
	- Gene Expression Munger (tool)
	- Differential Expression (tool)

##sonnet-grep
This tool looks for patterns in a text file (Shakespeare's 18th Sonnet) and outputs the lines that match. *grep* is a standard Linux command line tool.

##dna2protein
This workflow takes a input text file with a DNA sequence and outputs a text file with a peptide sequence from the first ORF, if possible. *dna2protein* is a custom workflow written in Python that is composed of *transcribe.py* (DNA -> mRNA) and *translate.py* (mRNA -> protein).

##GeneExpressionWF
This workflow produces a differential expression analysis from an array of Level 3 TCGA RNASeq Gene Expression Quantification files. It first merges the files into a single matrix and produces a "metadata matrix"  from the metadata (e.g. sample type, gender) from each individual case (*GeneExpressionMunger*, *munger.py*). It then runs a custom  differential expression analysis that produces a matrix of (adj) p-values per gene based on differences among sample-types (e.g. Solid Tissue Normal and Primary Tumor) as well as some plots in PDF (*DifferentialExpression*, *diff.R*). 

#Import tools from this repo into CGC Project
You can import any CWL JSON in these projects as a tool into the Cancer Genomics Cloud. First, you must [set up a CGC account](http://docs.cancergenomicscloud.org/docs/sign-up-for-the-cgc) and [create a project](http://docs.cancergenomicscloud.org/docs/create-a-project).

**Steps:**

1. In a project on the CGC, navigate to the Apps tab, then 'Add App'

2. Input a name for your app:

3. In the Tool Editor, click on '...' on the upper-right and then select 'Import':

4. You will see a blank window. Paste the contents of the CWL JSON file (*.cwl.json) from this repo:

)
5. Click 'Import'. You will see the appropriate fields in the Tool Editor window:
